# Depth of Field (DOF) Calculator

A comprehensive tool for photographers and photogrammetrists to calculate and visualize depth of field for various camera and lens combinations.

<!-- Note: Replace with an actual screenshot of your application once available -->
<!-- ![DOF Calculator](public/screenshot.png) -->

## Features

- **Precise DOF Calculations**: Calculate hyperfocal distance, near limit, far limit, and total depth of field
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visual representation of depth of field with distance scale
- **Multiple Sensor Formats**: Support for various sensor sizes including Large Format, Medium Format, Full Frame, and APS-C
- **Unit Conversion**: Seamlessly switch between metric (meters) and imperial (feet) units
- **Ground Coverage Calculation**: Determine the width and height of the area covered by your camera at a specific distance
- **Ground Sample Distance (GSD)**: Calculate the pixel resolution on the ground for photogrammetry applications
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Requirements

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cdav1990/Photogrammetry_DOF.git
   cd Photogrammetry_DOF
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in your terminal (typically http://localhost:5173 or similar)

## Usage

1. **Select Camera Format**: Choose your camera's sensor size from the dropdown menu
2. **Set Focal Length**: Enter the focal length of your lens in millimeters
3. **Set Aperture**: Select the f-stop value for your lens
4. **Adjust Focus Distance**: Use the slider or direct input to set your focus distance
5. **Toggle Units**: Switch between meters and feet using the toggle button
6. **View Results**: See the calculated DOF values and visualization

## Technical Details

### Core Calculations

The calculator implements the following key formulas:

- **Hyperfocal Distance**: The distance beyond which all objects appear acceptably sharp
- **Circle of Confusion**: The maximum blur spot diameter that will still be perceived as a point by the human eye
- **Near Limit**: The closest distance at which objects appear acceptably sharp
- **Far Limit**: The furthest distance at which objects appear acceptably sharp
- **Ground Sample Distance (GSD)**: The distance between pixel centers as measured on the ground

### Technology Stack

- **React**: Frontend UI library
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **D3.js**: For data visualization
- **CSS**: Custom styling with responsive design
